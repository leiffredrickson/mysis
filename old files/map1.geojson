Trout":"","Introduction_Mode":"Introduced","About":"In 1957, Colorado fisheries managers introduced mysis shrimp into Twin Lakes, making it the first site of a mysis shrimp introduction in the United States. (At the time, Twin Lakes was a natural lake, but in 1978 the Bureau of Reclamation dammed the outlet, forming Twin Lakes Reservoir.) Robert Pennak, a well-known expert on invertebrate freshwater organisms, first suggested introducing mysis shrimp for fish food in 1951. The 1957, fisheries workers dumped a thermos-full of mysis shrimp from Green Lake, Wisconsin into Twin Lakes. In describing the transplant, lead biologist W.D. Klein emphasized lake trout as a target species, but also mentioned that kokanee might benefit. Like many other experimental plants, the mysis shrimp were largely forgotten until a state biologist surveying the lakes in 1968 found the lakes teeming with them.  Biologists quickly deemed a �huge success,� based both on the establishment of mysids and the extensive use of them as food by lake trout. Beginning in 1970, the mysis population in Twin Lakes was used for transplants to 57 lakes in at least four states.
